# Flink on Native K8S

Kubernetes is a popular container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management. Flinkâ€™s native Kubernetes integration allows you to directly deploy Flink on a running Kubernetes cluster. Moreover, Flink is able to dynamically allocate and de-allocate TaskManagers depending on the required resources because it can directly talk to Kubernetes.

This tutorial will show how to deploy Apache Flink natively on Azure Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

Basic:

* [Git](https://www.git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8u211-later-archive-downloads.html)
* [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and [install](http://maven.apache.org/install.html) a Maven binary archive
* [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

Azure:

* [Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/)
* [Azure Kubernetes](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/)

## Build Flink Job

Build Flink job with Maven. 

e.g. on flink-streaming-example/

```
mvn clean package
```

## Create and Publish the Docker image to Azure Container Registry

The Flink community provides a base Docker image which can be used to bundle the user code:

```
ARG java_version=java8
ARG scala_version=scala_2.12
ARG flink_version=1.15.0
FROM flink:$flink_version-$scala_version-$java_version

ARG artifact_id=flink-example
ARG version=1.0-SNAPSHOT

RUN mkdir -p $FLINK_HOME/usrlib
COPY target/$artifact_id-$version.jar $FLINK_HOME/usrlib/$artifact_id-$version.jar
```

And you can build image and publish it into Azure Container Registry

```
az acr login --name $(registry)

docker build --no-cache -t $(registry).azurecr.io/$(artifact_id):$(version) .
docker push $(registry).azurecr.io/$(artifact_id):$(version)
```
